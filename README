You want to start with the file usagestatsfy23.py this code will read in all you usage stats regardless of file type. 
Then it will concatenate them all into one big spreadsheet. 
You can run the whole thing if you're working with Harrassowitz renewals, run the whole thing. 
If you're working on compiling statistics for ACRL, you can stop after you concatenate all your stats and then open up the code addallvalues and run that.
